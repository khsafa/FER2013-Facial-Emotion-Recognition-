# FER2013-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-
Simple CNN model for FER2013 dataset with ***64.78 accuracy*** on test data. The ***FER2013***[1],  was a challenge proposed on Kaggle which was won by the team reaching the test accuracy of 75.2%. The data set consists various 48x48 images partitioned into training, validation and testing data. The images are labelled for emotions and the labels are as follows:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral
***Human accuracy*** on the dataset is ***65.5%***[2] and a simple CNN model can be trained to achieve that accuracy.
